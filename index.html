I used a line of best fit to model the correlation in both charts. After making the first chart, I realized that the Happiness Score is heavily dependent on Region, so I divided up the scores by region. As you can see, for almost every region, there is a positive relationship between economy and happiness score. The only few exceptions are the regions with very similar economies and a limited amount of counties, like North America. </span></p><p><span>Additionally, only the years 2015-2019 were used because afterwards the metric for measuring Economy was changed. </span></p></div></div><div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:10px"><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;align-items:stretch"><div style="color:#303F9F;min-width:7em;font-family:monospace;text-align:right;padding-right:5px">In [<!-- -->10<!-- -->]:</div><div style="width:100%;border-radius:2px;position:relative;overflow-x:auto;border:1px solid rgb(207, 207, 207)"><pre class="CodeMirror cm-s-default  CodeMirror-wrap" style="width:100%;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;height:auto;font-size:inherit;margin-bottom:0;padding:4px;white-space:pre-wrap;word-wrap:break-word;word-break:normal;border:0;background:white"><div style="margin-left:0"><span class="cm-comment">#Scatterplot visualization of Economy vs Happiness Score</span><span>

Within the matrix, the main relationships that are being explored are Year vs. Happiness Score, Year vs. Trust Score, and Happiness Score vs. Trust Score. On top of these scatter plots, the data is colored by region to better understand where each data point is coming from. </span></p><p><span>The purpose of this visualization was to see whether global happiness scores changed at all throughout the years, whether global corruption (measured by trust in the government) altered changed throughout the years, and to determine whether happiness scores were dependent on trust scores.</span></p><p><span>Based on the scatter plot, there can be no conclusions drawn about the happiness scores by year. From 2015 to 2016, there does not seem to be any major drastic increases or decreases on happiness score, which indicates that global happiness has remained relatively consistent for the last eight years. On the other hand, the trust scores did show a dramatic increase from 2020-2021, which we previously noted, were the years that we were in a pandemic. Aside from these two years, trust scores also remained very consistent for the last eight years. Finally, looking at the relationship between happiness and corruption, there is little to no correlation meaning that it is most likely that trust in the government does not have a significant influence on global happiness scores.</span></p></div></div><div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:10px"><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;align-items:stretch"><div style="color:#303F9F;min-width:7em;font-family:monospace;text-align:right;padding-right:5px">In [<!-- -->11<!-- -->]:</div><div style="width:100%;border-radius:2px;position:relative;overflow-x:auto;border:1px solid rgb(207, 207, 207)"><pre class="CodeMirror cm-s-default  CodeMirror-wrap" style="width:100%;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;height:auto;font-size:inherit;margin-bottom:0;padding:4px;white-space:pre-wrap;word-wrap:break-word;word-break:normal;border:0;background:white"><div style="margin-left:0"><span class="cm-comment"># Matrix visualization between year, happiness score, and trust in government</span><span>

However, there were some notable regional differences as indicated by the patterns in coloring. Sub-Saharan African regions tended to show the lowest happiness scores while the North American and ANZ region tended to be better off. So to see this trend in more detail, we created bar graphs for every year since 2015 that represented the average happiness score by region. There were a total of eight bar graphs for each year, but only three are displayed below from 2015, 2018, and 2022 since the trends and patterns recognized seemed to stay pretty consistent throughout the years. </span></p><p><span>To create the bar chart, pandas was used to create a subset of the main data frame only representing data from one year. From there, the data was grouped by region, and the happiness scores from every region were averaged in order to better represent the happiness by region. Once a new dataframe was created by grouping the regions and finding each region&#x27;s average happiness score, we were able to use plotly to create the bar chart. </span></p><p><span>According to the graphs, we can see a common trend in which regions tend to have higher happiness scores and which ones usually score lower. Every year, Western Europe and North America had the highest average happiness score for their region, and for the most part, Australia and New Zealand also scored on the higher end. On the other hand, South Asian and African regions consistently sshowed lowest average happiness scores. So, overall, region has a big hold on people&#x27;s overall happiness, and some of the reason behind this can be connected to economic state. The higher scoring regions tended to be first world countries while the lower socring regions were third world. This indicates that an important factor that determines a person&#x27;s overall happiness could also be stability within their region.

Adding a new column to the dataframe to store this information, the ISO codes were used to indicate corresponding locations for different data points when creating the map with plotly. The parameters used to create this map in plotly include the countries&#x27; ISO codes to determine where to place the data, as well as the happiness score to determine the shading of the map according to a given color scale.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately, using the color scale to determine what each country&#x27;s happiness scores look like, we were able to reaffirm the conclusions drawn using the bar charts.

Using plotly, I created a scatterplot, colored by year, to help visualize the correlation between the two variables. As you can see, although the scatterplot itself shows a weak positive correlation, the line of best is more clear in showing the proportional relationship between the two for all years from 2015 to 2022. </span></p><p><span>However, the weak positive characteristics of the plot may cause some doubt and/or uncertainty, so I created a distplot to more clearly show the distribution of the happiness scores </span><span><span style="white-space:normal"> </span><span></span></span><span>in relation to the average mean of the freedom scores., which I found to be around 0.5. In other terms, I compared the happiness scores of countries with a freedom score below the mean to the countries with a freedom score above or equal to the mean. Looking at the distplot, we can see that the countries with a freedom score above or equal to the mean have happiness scores more distributed to the right, meaning that they, on average, have higher happiness scores than countries with less freedom.</span></p></div></div><div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:10px"><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;align-items:stretch"><div style="color:#303F9F;min-width:7em;font-family:monospace;text-align:right;padding-right:5px">In [<!-- -->14<!-- -->]:</div><div style="width:100%;border-radius:2px;position:relative;overflow-x:auto;border:1px solid rgb(207, 207, 207)"><pre class="CodeMirror cm-s-default  CodeMirror-wrap" style="width:100%;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;height:auto;font-size:inherit;margin-bottom:0;padding:4px;white-space:pre-wrap;word-wrap:break-word;word-break:normal;border:0;background:white"><div style="margin-left:0"><span class="cm-comment">#Scatterplot Visualization between Freedom and Happiness Score</span><span>

No correlation was found when comparing trust to happiness, so trust does not have any sort of influence on happiness. Similarly, we were incorrect about the influence of each year, as instead of showing any increase or decrease, global happiness remained consistent over the eight years. Additionally, we found that region played a major role in happiness, which connects back to the economic influence discussed earlier, as regions in less developed places tended to score lower than first world countries. </span></p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>
